    <h1>Pacific Rim</h1>
<p>Pacific Rim is a 2013 American monster action film directed by Guillermo del Toro. The first film in the Pacific Rim franchise, it stars Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay was written by Travis Beacham and del Toro, from a story by Beacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, a  bunch of colossal sea monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by two co-pilots whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.</p>
